**6Axis Animation** is an interactive, web-based application for visualizing complex mathematical functions and objects in a 3D space.  
It leverages **Three.js** for rendering and provides a powerful interface for creating, animating, and exploring explicit surfaces, parametric equations, vector fields, **linear algebra operations**, and more.

## ✨ Features

### 🔢 Multiple Plotting Modes

- **Playground**: A sandbox to add and manipulate multiple objects in the same scene.
- **Linear Algebra (NEW)**: Dedicated interactive tool for exploring linear algebra concepts with step-by-step visualization of operations like projections, eigen decomposition, Gram–Schmidt, and more.
- **Dedicated Modes**:
  - Explicit Surfaces: `z = f(x, y)`
  - Parametric Surfaces
  - Parametric Curves
  - Implicit Surfaces
  - Vector Fields

### 🎛️ Rich Interaction

- Full 3D camera controls (rotate, pan, zoom)
- Hover inspection to read coordinate data
- Real-time, LaTeX-style formula editing using **MathQuill**

- Object opacity controls
- Beautiful colormaps: Plasma, Viridis, Jet, and more
- Toggle wireframe mode and axis/grid visibility

### 📤 Export & Share

- Export current view as a **PNG**
- Export selected objects as **.STL** or **.GLTF**
- Save/load scene state as **.json**
- Generate a shareable, compressed **URL** snapshot

### 🧭 Helpful UI

- Step-by-step built-in **tutorial**
- **Zen Mode** for distraction-free exploration

## 🎬 Animation Features

The app includes a powerful animation engine using a global time variable `T`.

All animation is controlled through a right-hand **animation tray** with individual and global controls.

### Animation Modes

#### 🌀 V-Mode (Variable Animation)

Animate the **core geometry** of an object using the `T` variable.
- Example: `radius = 5 + sin(T)` for a pulsing sphere

#### 🔁 P-Mode (Transform Animation)

Animate **Position, Rotation, and Scale** using math expressions involving `T`.
- Example: Orbit: `X = 10 * cos(T)`, `Y = 10 * sin(T)`

#### 🚀 Physics Mode

A simple physics simulation between **waypoints**.
- Customize `Mass`, `Gravity`, and `Thrust = f(T)`
- Example: Rocket: `Thrust = if(T < 5, 2000, 0)`

### Playback Control

- **Per-object** play/pause, reset, and loop toggles
- **Global** play/pause/reset controls
- Configure `T`: min, max, and speed

## 🚀 How to Use

No installation required.

1. Clone or download the repo  
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)  
3. Start plotting and animating!  

### Navigation Between Apps

- **3D Graphing ↔ Linear Algebra**: Use the top navigation tabs to seamlessly switch between the main 3D graphing application and the dedicated Linear Algebra visualization tool.  
- Each app maintains its own state and provides specialized tools for its domain.
